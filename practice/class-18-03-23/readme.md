- URLs are designed to accept only certain characters in the standard 128-character ASCII character set. Reserved or unsafe ASCII characters which are not being used for their intended purpose, as well as characters not in this set, have to be encoded. URL encoding serves the purpose of replacing these non-conforming characters with a % symbol followed by two hexadecimal digits that represent the equivalent UTF-8 character.

Char | UTF - 8 Code

Space | %20
$ | %24
¬£ | %C2%A3
